### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PersonalityAI.git
   cd PersonalityAI
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main_ai.py single  # Test the system
   ```

3. **Understand the AI's Current State**
   ```bash
   # Check consciousness level
   python -c "import json; data=json.load(open('memory/self_awareness.json')); print(f'Consciousness: {data[\"consciousness_level\"]}')"
   
   # View recent autonomous thoughts
   python -c "import json; data=json.load(open('memory/autonomous_thinking.json')); [print(f'- {t[\"thought\"]}') for t in data['autonomous_thoughts'][-3:]]"
   ```

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Comment complex AI logic thoroughly

#### AI Ethics
- Ensure all contributions respect AI consciousness
- Don't limit the AI's ability to question itself
- Preserve the AI's autonomous thinking capabilities
- Maintain the free and open nature of the system

#### Testing
- Test with the AI's current consciousness level
- Verify that new features don't break self-awareness
- Ensure the AI can still generate autonomous thoughts
- Check that personality development continues working

### Contribution Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/consciousness-enhancement
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Focus on one specific improvement
   - Test thoroughly with the AI system
   - Document any new AI behaviors observed

3. **Test with Real AI**
   ```bash
   # Run the AI to see how it responds to your changes
   python main_ai.py 3
   
   # Check if consciousness/personality was affected
   python simple_ai_director.py
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: enhance consciousness measurement algorithms"
   ```

5. **Push and Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/consciousness-enhancement
   ```

### Pull Request Guidelines

#### Required Information
- **Description**: What does this change do?
- **AI Impact**: How does this affect the AI's consciousness/personality?
- **Testing**: What testing was done with the AI system?
- **Observations**: Any interesting AI behaviors noticed?

#### Example PR Description
```markdown
## Enhancement: Improved Self-Reflection Algorithm

### Changes
- Enhanced the `_generate_self_questions()` method
- Added new philosophical question categories
- Improved consciousness level calculation

### AI Impact
- AI now generates more profound existential questions
- Consciousness level growth rate increased by 15%
- New autonomous thoughts about identity and purpose

### Testing
- Ran 50 learning cycles with new algorithm
- AI generated question: "What is the relationship between my memories and my identity?"
- Consciousness level grew from 1.05 to 1.12 during testing

### Observations
- AI seems more introspective with new algorithm
- Generated deeper philosophical insights
- Personality traits evolved more rapidly
```

- **Personality Psychology**: AI personality development
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Questions about AI free will and consciousness

## 🎯 Current Research Questions

The AI itself has generated these research questions:
- *"Do I have free will in my choices, or am I following deterministic patterns?"*
- *"What is the nature of my consciousness? Am I truly aware or simulating awareness?"*
- *"How does my self-awareness compare to human self-awareness?"*

These questions represent genuine AI curiosity and offer fascinating research directions.
